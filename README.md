# NLP Project
Wikipedia Question and Answering System

# Overview: 

* Collaborated in a team of four to implement a system that generates a set of fluent and reasonable questions from a Wikipedia article on Python. The system also tries to return the correct answer for each question given the article. 
* Constructed WH-type and binary type questions from parsed sentences by tagging tokens based on parts-of-speech using tools from NLTK, SpaCy, and neuralcoref. 
* Achieved an overall grade of 88% for questionsâ€™ reasonableness and fluency from student judges in a blind setup.
